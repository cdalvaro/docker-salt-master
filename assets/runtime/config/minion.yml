##### Primary configuration settings #####
##########################################
# This configuration file is used to manage the behavior of the Salt Minion.
# With the exception of the location of the Salt Master Server, values that are
# commented out but have an empty line after the comment are defaults that need
# not be set in the config. If there is no blank line after the comment, the
# value is presented as an example and is not the default.

# Per default the minion will automatically include all config files
# from minion.d/*.conf (minion.d is a directory in the same directory
# as the main minion config file).
default_include: {{SALT_MINION_CONFS_DIR}}/*.conf

# Set the location of the salt master server. If the master server cannot be
# resolved, then the minion will fail to start.
master: 0.0.0.0

# Set the port used by the master reply and authentication server.
master_port: 4506

# The user to run salt.
user: root

# The directory to store the pki information in
pki_dir: {{SALT_MINION_KEYS_DIR}}

# Explicitly declare the id for this minion to use, if left commented the id
# will be the hostname as returned by the python call: socket.getfqdn()
# Since salt uses detached ids it is possible to run multiple minions on the
# same machine but with different ids, this can be useful for salt compute
# clusters.
id: {{SALT_MINION_ID}}

# Where cache data goes.
# This data may contain sensitive data and should be protected accordingly.
